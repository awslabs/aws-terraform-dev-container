  <summary>Expand</summary>

Once you have opened your project with VSCode Dev Containers:
1. In the terminal, export the AWS environment variables.
2. Execute the following commands

```bash
make pre-commit/run
```
Notice the warnings and errors raised by [tfsec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec), [checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov), and/or [terrascan](https://github.com/tenable/terrascan).
These messages allow us to improve the security of our solution overall. For this tutorial, we will ignore them.

```bash
make terraform/plan
make terraform/apply
make terraform/destroy
```

To generate documentation powered by [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs):
```bash
# you can combine two Make targets
make terraform-docs/init terraform-docs/build
```

To build your project's documentation
```bash
make doc/build
````
Notice the creation, or update, of the README.md.
You can have a closer look into each Make target [here](.devcontainer/lib/make).
